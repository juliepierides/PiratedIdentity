## Story
Pirates stole your identity and now you don’t remember who you are. You can kill enemies to gain their respective color and transform into a different form. With the form you think is the correct one, you will have to find your captured identity.

## Interesting Mechanics
Defeating an enemy of a certain color adds that color to the player’s color bar. The player changes her color based on the bar that has the most points. Minibosses have no color but will drop memory hints to what your reflection color will be.

There is a switch in one of the rooms that allows the player to shift the position of the bridges that connect the rooms. This makes the player have to more carefully pay attention to the route that she wants to take in order to get to her goal.

There is a boat that constantly loops around the map. The player can ride it as a sort of shortcut to get around the map but must think about the route that she wants to take first.

## Installation Requirements

No additional installation is required. All assets are retained in the Unity game folder. 

## Gameplay Instructions
Inside the Build folder, start up the game by double clicking “PiratedIdentity.exe”. Then on the main menu, hit play. After a brief cutscene, you will be brought to into the main game.

## Controls
- Our game’s choice of controls is intuitive and appropriate. This is because we chose the common mmorpg style controls. WASD to move the character and the left mouse button to attack. This allows the player to comfortably move the character with their left hand and shoot using their right hand. 

- Below is our controls book detailing the objective and controls of the game:





## Summary
Pirated Identity is  a 3D game that can be defined as a Game Feel game. It is a third person action/shooter with an explorable world and story.
## Goal
The game has a clearly defined, achievable objective/goal. The player’s object is to search for their reflection and match their color. This is hinted during the cutscene, and also in the book instructions in the starting room. The book is placed in one of the corners of the starting room indicated by a ring of blue light. Press the spacebar to read the book. If the player reaches the reflection door without a key, a popup will indicate they need to find a key.
## Components
- Our game has appeal because there are no glitches, no way to easily escape the confines of the game world, the player does not get stuck, and the game is very stable
- Does not use tutorial characters, nor does it use a complete prepackages asset. Instead, we created a well animated character via mecanim that blends between different animations based on the player’s inputs. The blend tree has a combination of walk, run, and turn animations based on the x and y variables of its motion. This allows the player to walk in short distances but run for longer. The base layer allows the character to move and fall via root motion. You can see these animations by using the WASD keys. There are additional layers for extra animation while moving. These include attacking, getting hurt, and a healing animation. You can see the attacking animation by pressing the left mouse key. You can see the hurt animation when the enemy comes to close to the player. Lastly, you can see the healing animation when you enter the health room. The animations are well-responsive and very smooth. 
### Gameplay
- The game communicates to the player clearly whether they have succeeded or failed when the player enters the end room. If you proceed to the end room and match the color of your reflection then win screen will be shown. If you lose, character falls off map, or character health went to 0 then lose screen is shown
- Has a starting splash screen that can load up the game cutscene as well as the credit menu and the option to quit the game. 
- The player is able to reset and replay on win or lose screens. 
- Goals/subgoals are effectively communicated to the player. The goal of the game is communicated to the player through the opening cutscene. In-game, the starting room contains a book that explains the battle mechanics of the game, controls, and objectives. This book is indicated as important through shiny particle systems as well as a UI that tells the player to press the spacebar to read the book.
- Our game provides interesting choices to the player. Depending on the choices, the player can also face consequences. This is seen in our battle mechanic. Whenever a player defeats an enemy, the respective color bar will be filled. When the player has gathered enough points in one color they will transform into that color. The player has the choice of defeating or hiding from the enemies to strategically transform into the correct color.
- Player choices engage the player. This can be seen when the player rides the boat and the squid comes out to say hi. 
- Player choices engage the player with the game world. This can be seen through the hallway trigger element in our game. Depending on the placement of the player and where they need to go. 
- Our game is challenging, but fair. Enemies do a light amount of damage and our bosses do much more. It is conveyed to the player that the bosses do more damage because of their large sizes. Another fair aspect of the game is the boat. It can be a shortcut, but it is a risk to get on it since falling off will automatically kill you.
- Rewards player for successes when they defeat the boss and receive hints that allow the player to know what her true identity is. Also, the player can be punished for failure by reaching 0 health and having to restart. 
- Has in-game learning/training opportunities through the interactive book in the starting room. 
- Has an appropriate progression of difficulty as smaller enemies do less damage and the bosses are easier to kill.
- Avoids opportunities for players to trivially beat your game challenges as it requires the player to find the key room, obtain the key, find the end room while being the correct color which requires them to kill enemies.
### Animation
- The player model has fluid animation that is well blended. Even when the player ids not doing anything, there is an idle motion to make it interesting. There are no no instantaneous pose changes, no glitching, unintended teleporting, a ground-based character stuck floating in air. 
- Humanoid characters does not slide or moonwalk. We used root motion, with IK corrections.
- Our game has 3D simulation with six degrees of freedom movement of rigid bodies
- We have low latency responsiveness to control inputs.
- Camera is smooth with little delay. This allows the player to move quickly during combat without becoming frustrated by the camera.
- Camera has limited passing through walls, near clipping plane cutting through objects (e.g. player model), etc. 
### Art and Audio
- Auditory feedback on character state and actions (e.g. footsteps, landing, collisions, tire squeal, engine revs, etc.)
- Coupling with physics simulation via animation curves, animation callback events, handoff to ragdoll simulation, IK adjustments to animations, vehicle that breaks up in wrecks, etc.
- We created the entire environment from scratch using 3D cubes and planes as well as prefabs from the asset store for additional props. - Obtained seamless texture images to create materials. Created normal maps of the texture images through Photoshop for extra detail.
- Our game has a semi-realistic art style with a pastel and neutral color palette
- Our music themes are from other games that have both dramatic tracks and upbeat tracks such as Super Mario Odyssey, Breath of the Wild, Final Fantasy, and Super Mario Galaxy.

### Interactive environment:
  - Barrels and crates can be pushed around and shot at
  - Animated boat can carry the player around the map
  - Health room heals the player
  - Book in the starting room can be read when player is near it
  - Key can be picked up
  - Bridges can be switched
  - The player is appropriately confined to the playable space through walls. However, the player may fall out and drown into the ocean. 
  - Variety of environmental physical interactions including:
    - Interactive scripted objects in the form of triggers that change the layout of the hallways. Keys that can be picked up to open doors. 
  - Simulated Newtonian physics rigid body objects in the form of crates and barrels have newtonian physics rigid bodies. Players can move them around and shoot at them.
  - Animated objects using Mecanim such as the squid’s animation and programmatic pose changes in the form of a moving boat that allows the player to get on and off. Shortcut around rooms but are hard to get on and off.
- Consistent spatial simulation throughout the game as running speed remains same regardless of framerate. 
- Uses a combination of assets from the asset store that have been well modified from its original form. 
### Artificial Intelligence
- Multiple AI states of behavior. AI would have an idle and attack state. When the player is not in the range of the room, the AI will be in idle state. When the player is in the range, the AI will be in attack state. 
- The enemy jump up and down and try to reach you when they find you.
- The AI can sense the player enter or exit the room.
- There is no sudden change of animation. All the animation are blended.
- There is sound when the enemy being hit and dead. Visually, you can see the enemy falls back when it is being hit.
- Small enemy deal fair amount damage. The boss would deal more attack in a slower rate than the small enemy. Small enemy and boss would both walk slower than player in order to avoid unbeatable enemy.
- AI has a fair intercept between each attack and gives a chance to the player to run away.
- AI can use barrels as a block to protect himself from the attack of the player while trying to attack player.

### User Interface/User Experience
- Implements a start menu GUI on game load up with the ability to load the cutscenes, a credits screen, and a quit button
- Iimplements a in-game pause menu with the ability to quit. This is done by pressing the ESC key at any point. This includes the main game and during the cutscenes with the additional ability to skip. 
- Feels like a game from start of execution to the end. This is done with looping states from the start menu, in game, win/lose screens. 
- Player has the ability to exit software at any time. The player has the ability to quit on pause menu and on starting screen/win screen/lose screen. Can also quit on the main menu, and you can press ESC key during cutscene to bring up pause menu to quit.
- GUI elements are styled appropriately and consistently. The elements have been scaled to fit within canvas and readable.
- Transitions between scenes are done aesthetically. This is achieved whenthe Start menu “Play” button loads up the animated cutscenes. - Going from cutscenes to in game, or pressing win/lose screen restart button, makes the camera pan from out of the world towards the player. 
### Environment acknowledges the player:
  - Has scripted aesthetic animations through water animations. The waves can be seen through the openings in the rooms.
  - Proximity-based events. A giant squid will appear and float when you get on the boat. More specifically, if you are standing in the boat on either the left or right side of the map, the squid will enlarge and bob.
  - Auditory representation of every observable game event
  - Physics event-based feedback such as particle effects and one-shot audio for collisions of different types
  - Sonifications that map physical properties to audio effects.Examples include sound effects when you enter a healing room. 



## Known Bugs

StartMenu.Unity
- Error: Assets/Fast Cutscene Producer Free/Demo Assets/Misc/Concrete_02.sbsar: Built-in support for Substance Designer materials has been removed from Unity. To continue using Substance Designer materials, you will need to install Allegorithmic's external importer from the Asset Store.
This bug occasionally appears ONLY in the unity editor, not during the game scenes. This bug does not impact the game in any way, just that it's a depreciated asset that we still needed to use for our cutscenes. 

MainGame.Unity
- Error: Screen position out of view frustum (screen pos 125.000000, 0.000000, 1000.000000) (Camera rect 0 0 125 100)
Sometimes this bug appears when in Unity editor mode. We aren’t sure why this appears, but it may be due to various display screen resizing. However it does not impact the game and does not show an error when running the game.
